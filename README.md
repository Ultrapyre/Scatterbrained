## Description:

This application allows you to type up and save tasks, which you can view, edit and delete at your leisure for the purposes of organization. 

While not the most complex in function, it works well enough! More or less.

## Table of Contents:

- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Questions](#questions)


## Usage:

After signing up for an account, you can go to the 'My Tasks' page to set up a new task by pressing on the corresponding button. After that, you can examine the finer details by pressing on the 'details' button on the task itself.

From there, you can update the task's details or remove it, just by pressing on the corresponding buttons.
